# Dartmouth-EEES-Modeling-Group
This repository serves as a public forum for holding R code, tutorials, example data, and other resources for the Dartmouth EEES modeling group.

Ideally, this will ultimately hold code for all the workshops we have run in the past so they can be easily repeated in the future.

The following are the names of folders included in our Github repository and their descriptions:
1) Datasets: All of the various datasets used for different tutorials. All datasets included are .csv files for maximum compatibility with R.
