# Dartmouth-EEES-Modeling-Group
This repository serves as a public forum for holding R code, tutorials, example data, and other resources for the Dartmouth EEES modeling group.

Ideally, this will ultimately hold code for all the workshops we have run in the past so they can be easily repeated in the future.
